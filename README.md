# Linear Regression Example with Scikit-Learn

This script demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple **Linear Regression model** using the Python library **scikit-learn**. The example predicts test scores based on the number of hours studied.

## Features

- **Dataset**: A small sample dataset (`Hours_Studied` vs `Test_Score`).
- **Preprocessing**: Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Model**: Trains a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation**: Computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the predictions.
- **Insights**: Outputs the model's slope (coefficient) and intercept.

---

## Requirements

To run this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- `scikit-learn` (Install via `pip install scikit-learn`)
- `pandas` (Install via `pip install pandas`)
- `numpy` (Install via `pip install numpy`)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression_example.py
   ```

---

## Output Example

When you run the script, you’ll see output similar to this:

```
Mean Squared Error: 6.25
Model Coefficient (Slope): 5.5
Model Intercept: 15.0
```

This means:
- The model predicts that for each additional hour studied, the test score increases by 5.5 points.
- The intercept indicates that if a student studies 0 hours, the predicted test score would be 15.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Linear Regression**: A simple algorithm to predict numerical outcomes.
- **Train/Test Split**: Partitioning data to train and evaluate the model.
- **Mean Squared Error**: A metric to measure the accuracy of predictions.

---

## Customization

- Modify the dataset (`data` dictionary) to explore different scenarios.
- Adjust the `test_size` parameter in `train_test_split` to change the train/test ratio.
- Use the model to predict other continuous outcomes by replacing `Hours_Studied` and `Test_Score` with your data.
